## Day 1: Python Setup and Control Flow

### Topics Covered:

- Setting up Anaconda/Miniconda
- Creating a virtual environment
- Installing Python
- Git and GitHub basics
- Study Python control flow tools from the official tutorial (sections 3 through 4.6, "Pass statement")
	- Numbers, Text, Lists
	- `if` statement
	- `for` loop
	- `range()` function
	- `break` statement
	- `continue` statement
	- `else` clauses on loops
	- `pass` statement

### Key Concepts:

#### Setting up Anaconda/Miniconda

1. Downloaded and installed Miniconda from the official website.
2. Created a new environment with: `conda create -n NSD-repro python=3.9` for reproduction of the paper
3. Activated the environment with: `conda activate NSD-repro`

### Reflections/Challenges:

- Real-time Summarization: I realized it would be more efficient to write summaries *during* my study sessions rather than trying to recall everything at the end. This will help me retain information better.
- Code Preservation: I regret not saving all the code snippets I wrote while experimenting with the concepts. I'll make sure to *save* all my code files going forward so I can refer back to them and build upon them.
- Use Case Documentation: I realized that it's not enough to just understand the syntax of a concept. I need to also think about *where* I can apply it. From now on, I'll add a section to my notes summarizing potential use cases for each concept (e.g., using `range()` for generating indices to access elements in a list).
