# Day 5: NumPy for NSD Reproduction

## Scripts and What They Demonstrate

- **1_numpy_basics.py**: Array creation, element-wise math, and NumPy vs. Python lists.
- **2_matrix_manipulation.py**: Indexing, slicing, reshaping, and transposing
- **3_scientific_computing_example.py**: Implemented Mean Squared Error (MSE) using vectorized NumPy code.
- **4_nsd_reproduction_prep.py**: Built a graph Laplacian in NumPy, set up edge indices and edge maps (as in NSD).

## How This Prepares Me for NSD
- All these skills are directly used in the NSD model: graph Laplacians, feature matrices, and vectorized operations are the foundation of the code Iâ€™ll write in PyTorch next.
