# Reproduce-Neural-Sheaf-Diffusion-A-Topological-Perspective-on-Heterophily-and-Oversmoothing-in-GNNs

## Project Goal

This repository documents my journey to reproduce the experiments from the paper  
**"Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs."**  
My aim is to understand and implement the main results using Python and related libraries.

## Timeline

- **Start Date:** June 4, 2025
- **End Date:** July 20, 2025  
(A total of 7 weeks)

## About This Project

I am a graduate student in mathematics, transitioning from symplectic geometry to topological deep learning (TDL).  
This project is both a learning journey and a technical challenge:  
- I am new to Python and modern coding practices.
- I will document every step, including environment setup, code exploration, and experiment reproduction.

## Week 1 Progress

- [ ] Set up Python environment (Anaconda/Miniconda)
- [ ] Learn Python basics (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- [ ] Set up Git and GitHub repository
- [ ] Write initial README and project plan
- [ ] Skim the target paper and official code repository

*Progress will be updated at the end of each week.*
